## About Me:  :alien:
I am a CS undergraduate at **Vemana Institute of Technolgy, B'luru | India**. </br>
Currently looking for an internship in the web development and designing field.

I love exploring new front-end technologies and experimenting them with building prototypes.:shipit: </br>
In this lockdown, I attempted to delve myself into learning Data Science and Machine Learning. ðŸŒ±</br>
And have also recently started to practice solving code problems on GFG to tackle those Coding Rounds.
